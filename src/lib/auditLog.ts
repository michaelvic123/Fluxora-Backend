/**
 * Audit log for sensitive actions.
 *
 * Records immutable entries whenever a privileged state-changing operation
 * occurs (stream create, stream cancel). Entries are append-only; nothing
 * in this module mutates or removes existing records.
 *
 * Trust boundaries
 * - Internal workers call `recordAuditEvent` directly.
 * - Administrators may query entries via GET /api/audit.
 * - Public clients and authenticated partners have no access to this log.
 *
 * Failure modes
 * - Recording never throws; a failed write is logged to stderr and silently
 *   dropped so the primary operation is never blocked by audit infrastructure.
 *
 * Non-goals (follow-up)
 * - Persistent storage (PostgreSQL audit table).
 * - Pagination / filtering beyond what is provided here.
 * - Tamper-evidence / cryptographic chaining.
